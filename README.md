# Game Dev Repo  

currently, you don't need to worry about downloading anything.

This is to everyone who's signed up for our Intro to game Development Workshop,
which is just one week away!

As a reminder, we're presenting next Saturday, November 7th, 1pm - 4pm.

There are a few things you will want to have ready, if you intend to code-along and participate.

1. Java
If you haven't used java before, you'll need to install it.

You may need to update your Java Home Environment Variables,
here's a tutorial.

2. Intellij
We'll be coding using Jetbrains's Intellij IDE.
If you need it, here's a link to the education pack

3. LibGDX
Finally, you'll need LibGDX itself. Download and extract it to the gdx-setup.jar
Once you have that, you can run it and set up a project to open in intellij.

4. Our Github
We'll be putting up files, assets, examples, and helpful resources for use during and after
the presentation.

If you need any help, we'll actually be in Zoom answering questions at noon, before the event.

Finally, Here is your invite to the Zoom Call.

We'll see you soon.
